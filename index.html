<div id="about">
  <div id="name">Hello! I'm Sophia</div>
  <div id="bio">
    <p>
    I'm building <a href="http://auxpanel.com">Auxpanel</a>, practice intelligence and analytics software for DSOs and large dental practice groups across the US. We bootstrapped it to profitability, which I talk about <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisongilbert/2018/07/15/this-founder-bootstrapped-a-profitable-saas-product-for-dentists-in-under-three-years/?sh=5cd20c561407">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Before Auxpanel, I helped a couple of startups build and grow their software products (<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3019976/polish-your-resume-and-apply-for-that-dream-job-directly-from-your">1</a>, <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2013/10/55473/levo-league-resume-app">2</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2014/12/16/a-black-hole-for-our-best-and-brightest/">3</a>, and <a href="https://fortune.com/2016/04/25/plum-alley-investments/">4</a>. Even longer before that (around 2012), I was a practicing dentist. Some people still know me as Dr. Chou.
    </p>
    <p>
    I grew up in Shanghai, San Francisco, Chicago, Vancouver BC, and finally Boston, where I'm currently based with my partner, <a href="http://foysavas.com">Foy</a>, and our child, Byron. I lived in Manhattan for most of my adulthood and still spend a lot of time there.
    </p>
    <p>
    I like heady films, aesthetics, building delightful software products, multigenerational family businesses, generative art, amateur gardening, and wild optimism.
    <p>
    Sometimes I angel invest in areas I understand or care about (healthcare tech, vertical SaaS, AgeTech, EdTech, and infra/security).
    </p>
    <p>
    I recently started sharing <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wSPus74qL1Rheb0aEdaRteYNO4DFqO73pz5l-GhhJjs/edit?usp=sharing">books I'm reading</a>. I'd love to hear your recommendations.
